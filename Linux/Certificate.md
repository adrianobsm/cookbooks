## Installing a root/CA Certificate

Given a CA certificate file 'foo.crt', follow these steps to install it on Ubuntu:

1.  Create a directory for extra CA certificates in /usr/share/ca-certificates

```sh
sudo mkdir /usr/share/ca-certificates/extra
```

2.  Copy the '.crt' file to the directory

```sh
sudo cp foo.crt /usr/share/ca-certificates/extra/foo.crt
```

3.  Let Ubuntu add the '.crt' file's path relative to /usr/share/ca-certificates to /etc/ca-certificates.conf

```sh
sudo dpkg-reconfigure ca-certificates
```
