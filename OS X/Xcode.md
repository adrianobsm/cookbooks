## Installation

## Issues

### Agreeing License

```
Agreeing to the Xcode/iOS license requires admin privileges, please re-run as root via sudo.
```

```sh
sudo xcodebuild -license
```

Or open Xcode and accept the terms.

### Tool `xcodebuild` Requires Xcode

```
xcode-select: error: tool 'xcodebuild' requires Xcode, but active developer directory '/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools' is a command line tools instance
```

```sh
sudo xcode-select -s /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer
```
