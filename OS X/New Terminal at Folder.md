# New Terminal at Folder

Opening a new terminal in any folder is not enabled by default under Mac OS X. Here is a tip to enable this powerful feature:

1.  Go to **System Preferences**
2.  Click on the **Keyboard** icon
3.  Click on the **Shortcuts** panel
4.  Click on the **Services** entry
5.  Enable the **New Terminal at Folder** checkbox

Now you can open a terminal in any folder from Finder.
